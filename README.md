# Windows 10 IoT Core Workshop
This project is a simple traffic lights simulator, created by me and my mate Giulio Migani *@miga97* to demonstrate how Windows 10 IoT Core, running on a Raspberry Pi 3, can allow you to connect simple everyday things as buttons and lights to the Internet.

### School Maker Day 2015 @ Bologna, Italy üåè 
I had the chance to run a workshop and present this project as a sample during the **School Maker Day 2015** in Bologna, Italy. It's an event happening every year where students from several High Schools of northern Italy show their DIY projects. There are many teachers, experts and technology companies there to run seminars and workshops, collaborate with students and have a look at what the next generation of makers is building.
